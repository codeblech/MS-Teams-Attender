## How It Works
The scripts use the Selenium WebDriver to interact with the Teams web application in a Chrome browser. The WebDriver can find elements on the web page, click buttons, fill in text fields, and more.  

The scripts follow a schedule defined by a set of start and end times for different subjects (Physics, Computer Science, English, Chemistry, and Maths). When run, the scripts will wait until the start time of the next subject, then find and join the corresponding meeting on Teams.
